# MSc-NetworkAnalytics

The project is to understand how the traders at a bank can be persuaded to adopt AI tools based on their current opinions about AI - gauged using a survey - and of those in their surroundings. 

The dataset containts the undirected network of knowledge exchange between traders (traders A and B are connected when A says he/she shares technical and industry knowledge with B and vice versa)
a trader's opinion about the contribution of AI to his/her productivity and effectiveness in evaluating securities (1 = not at all; 10 = to a great extent). In the datasets, this variable is reported as the node attribute ai.
The traders' locations on the floor - there are six zones, each of which hosts 32 individuals (16 individuals on each side of the zone). The location of traders is reported as two node attributes, that is, x-pos and y-pos.

How do traders' opinions map onto the knowledge exchange network?
How do traders' opinions map onto the physical layout of the trading floor?
What are the network-related obstacles to the diffusion of positive opinions about AI in the trading floor?
What is your recommendation to promote the diffusion of positive opinions about AI in the trading floor?
